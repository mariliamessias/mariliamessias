<p>Hi, I'm Mar√≠lia. I'm currently learning about backend and frontend development in general, like Java, React, MongoDB, MySQL, NodeJs and Kotlin. In my repositories you can see many projects about this technologies. I think mobile development is really cool and this will be my new topic of study, if you want share things with me on this subject, it would be really cool. </p> 

<p>About me, I like to cook for my fiance and draw in my free time. I love animes and all about Japanese culture.</p>
